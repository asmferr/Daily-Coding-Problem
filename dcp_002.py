This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an list of integers, return a new list such that each element at index i of the new list 
is the product of all the numbers in the original list except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would 
be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you canâ€™t use division?
